- 👋 Hi, I’m @BetsySS
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about UX/UI design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS and HTML while I study UX information architecture
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project where I could help out while learning the ropes and maybe meeting a mentor
- 📫 Please feel free to reach out to me with suggestions and advice, or especially if you have an opportunity for me to assist on a project to build my portfolio.
